### How to play this game:

This is a game that will match you up with the most compatible person in the Stardew Valley Game.
There is a survey that will ask you a bunch of questions that will narrow done the field of potential suitors.
Since this game has a multiplayer aspect to it, once you have taken the survey, you will be added to the list of potential candiates
that take this survey in the future! They score you get back from your match will reflect how differently you answered the survey, so the lower the score the better. You will be able to view all of the currently stored matches through either a nicely styled html page, which is the button labeled "View Matches", or you can look at the list of matches in the ever exciting JSON format by clicking the button labeled "Matches API". Enjoy finding out who is Mr/Ms. Right for you!
